CHALLENGE GUIDELINES:

It is a html only page. styling will be added at a later date.

We have 3 pricing cards. A `card` in UI design is a container that holds information. 
They typically have a border and a shadow to make them stand out. 
Each card has a heading, price, price info, main text, a button, and a list of features.

Here are the specifics:

- Everything should be wrapped in a `div` with the class of `container`.

- The 3 cards should be wrapped in a parent `div` with the class of `pricing`. 
        This will be used as a flexbox container later, when we get to that.

- Each of the 3 cards should be wrapped in a `div` with the class of `card`.

- The heading should be an `h2` tag.

- The price should be a `p` tag with the class of `price`.

- The price info should be a `p` tag with the class of `price-info`.

- Make the price info text bold with the `strong` tag.

- The main text should be a `p` tag with the class of `main-text`.

- The button should be an `a` tag with the class of `btn`.

- The list of features should in be an `ul` tag.

- Each feature should be an `li` tag.

- The '$' should be wrapped in a `sup` tag.

- The text '/mo' should be wrapped in a `span` tag.
